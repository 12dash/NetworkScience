# NetworkScience
Coauthorship data from the DBLP computer science bibliography for SCSE Faculty network was used to create collaboration networks, where authors (nodes) are connected with an edge if they have co-authored at least one paper. Through our work in this report, we aim to answer the following question: “Can network science help us to understand research collaboration among SCSE faculty members over time and, if possible, explain the reputation growth?”
